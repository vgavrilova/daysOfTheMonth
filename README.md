# daysOfTheMonth

Hey everyone!

In this program you can find out how many days there are in a specific month in the inserted year. 

The program also checks, whether the year is a leap year and changes the number of days in February according to this. Firstly, I've created a method that returns a boolean dependint on the leap year.
The second method recieves this value and returns the number of days in the month.


Have fun!
